## Testing Documentation

# General Standards

Tests follow Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles where each test method follows a similar structure:

- Given: Set up the test scenario by defining inputs and expected behavior.
- When: Execute the method being tested with the defined inputs.
- Then: Assert the expected behavior based on the method's output.
